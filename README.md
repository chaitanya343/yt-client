# Custom Youtube client with React

### I created this fun project while learning React for my personal use

So I waste a lot of time on Youtube, much like everyone. I start coming to youtube to listen to music while I code and then eventually get distracted by the tailored recommendations. I thought of making the web client to break that distractions by removing the recommendations page and just displaying the seach bar and the video. 

The web client is deployed on Netlify here : https://jovial-jackson-43cb74.netlify.app/
