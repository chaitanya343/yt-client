# Custom Youtube client with React

### I created this fun project while learning React for my personal use

So I waste a lot of time on Youtube, much like everyone. I start coming to youtube to listen to music while I code and then eventually get distracted by the tailored recommendations. I thought of making the web client to break that distractions by removing the recommendations page and just displaying the seach bar and the video.
